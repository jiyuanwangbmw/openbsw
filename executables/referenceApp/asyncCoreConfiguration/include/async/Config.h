/**
 * There are two implicit contexts/tasks: One is TASK_IDLE with the value 0 and the other is
 * TASK_TIMER with its value equal to ASYNC_CONFIG_TASK_COUNT. This implies that the actual number
 * of tasks in the system is not equal to ASYNC_CONFIG_TASK_COUNT but to ASYNC_CONFIG_TASK_COUNT+1.
 * And don't forget about the fact that we start counting at 1 here. To sum it up: If there are 3
 * entries in this enum, there are actually 5 tasks in the system.
 * See asyncFreeRtos/include/async/FreeRtosAdapter.h
